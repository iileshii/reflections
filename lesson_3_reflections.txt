When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code or when I'm going to work on different computers or in collaboration with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because somebody may changes this repository and I can face not I expected to face.
